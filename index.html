    <h1>Small Steps We Can All Take To Reduce Our Carbon Footprint</h1>
</title>
<body>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>So this global warming thing, you know it's real right? Scientists have predicted an impending climate crisis in the next X years, unless drastic steps are taken to curb our production of CO2.
         It can seem like getting our government on board with smart climate policies is never going to happen. Or, if it does happen, it will be too late. This can seem more than a bit disheartening, 
         But I believe we don't have to wait for our government to act to affect change. Here are a few ideas that can have a major impact on your personnal carbon output (aka carbon footprint). I believe
         we can be an example for those around us and impact the culture around waste and consummerism to create the change we wish to see.  </p>
