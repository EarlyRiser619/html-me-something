    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>In my life, there have been few issues that have impacted the way I do things day-to-day like climate change. Being born in the mid-80's,
        I grew up being taught about the pollution that people produce just by living our lives the way we do, and how that is impacting the world
         around us. It can be intimidaing to accept the responsibility of being a good steward of our planet, especially when the fate of generations 
         hinges on the next few years. There was a point in my life, a little over 20 years ago when I decided that everyone else could do as they pleased, 
         but I would make the choice to help in my own small way. There are many small (and large) adjustments we can each make in our day to day lives 
         that would have a positive imapact on our global future. Here are a few ideas that can help reduce your carbon footprint. I believe we can set an 
         example for those around us and influence the culture around waste and consummerism to create the change we wish to see.  </p>
