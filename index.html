    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>So this global warming thing, you know it's real right? Scientists have predicted an impeding climate catastrophe in the next X years, unless drastic steps are taken to curb our production of CO2.
         It can seem like getting our government on board with smart climate policies is never going to happen. Or, if it does happen, it will be too late. This can seem more than a bit disheartening, 
         but I believe we don't have to wait for our government to act to effect change. Here are a few ideas that can have a major impact on your personnal carbon output (aka carbon footprint). I believe
